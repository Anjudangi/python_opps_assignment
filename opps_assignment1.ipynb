    "Ans.2 The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. \n",
    "Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps to protect the integrity of the data and ensures that it can only\n",
    "be changed in controlled ways. Access to the data is typically provided through public methods (getters and setters).\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of the objects while hiding \n",
    "unnecessary details. This allows programmers to work at a higher level of complexity and focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class (called a superclass or\n",
    "base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes, where the subclass can extend or modify the functionality\n",
    "of the superclass.\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a single action \n",
    "in different forms. There are two types of polymorphism:\n",
    "Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading): Achieved by defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class.\n",
    "Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding): Achieved when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its \n",
    "superclass.\n",
    "These four pillars form the foundation of OOP, enabling developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.\n"

    "Ans.4 In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), self is a conventional name used as the first parameter in instance methods within a class. It refers to the instance of the class itself and is used to access the attributes and methods associated with that specific instance. Here's why self is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for Using self:\n",
    "Instance Reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "self allows you to reference the specific instance of the class when calling its methods or accessing its attributes. This is particularly important\n",

    "Distinguishing Between Instance and Local Variables:\n",

    "if you have a method parameter with the same name as an instance attribute, you can use self to refer to the instance attribute.\n",
    "Enabling Object State Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "By using self, you can manage the state of an object. You can modify the object's attributes and have those changes persist as long as the object exists.\n",
